# myChattingProject

This project demonstrates a basic web-based chat interface that uses the Gemini API.
Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `chat.js` with your own key before running.

## Running
Open `index.html` in a browser to test the chat UI. Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in `chat.js` with a valid Gemini API key.

**Security note:** API keys should not be shared publicly or committed to any public repository. This example keeps the key inline only for demonstration.
